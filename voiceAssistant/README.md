##üéôÔ∏è Python Voice Assistant
A simple voice-controlled assistant built with Python. This project utilizes speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and webbrowser to understand voice commands and perform basic tasks like:

Greeting the user

Telling the current time and date

Searching Google with voice input

Ending the session with a voice command

This assistant runs in a loop, listening and responding to your voice in real-time. A great foundation for expanding into more advanced AI-powered voice applications.
